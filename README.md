# Product Managment App

This app created with Electron with React and developed based on [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

# Appllication Purpose

I'm doing a review of products and products deliveries, and somtime I can have at the same time 10-15 products that on their way, and it can be a big mess.
My solution to solve this problem it to split my reviews and products to directories for manage all these.

- My files and data is saved in this way:

  ```
  ~/Products
  ├── 2019
  |   ├── product 1
  |   ├── product 2
  |   ....
  |── 2020
  |   ├── product 1
  |   ├── product 2
  |   ....
  |── 2021
  |   ├── product 1
  |   ├── product 2
  |   ....
  ```

This solution very helped me to orgenize everything but I thought about solution that will help me to order everything with minimal effort.

# Usage

After little bit of thinking I thought about develop this application.
The application will orgenize everything in directories and files in your selected path, and with GUI actions it will create everything I need to orgenize my products and their status (On delivery, reviewed, paid... and more).

## images and more explnation will be updated when the application is Done
